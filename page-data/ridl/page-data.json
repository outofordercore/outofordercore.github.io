In the exploit outlined in paper, the attacker can only manage to read some bytes per day from a victim that is continuously loading same data in a loop. However we see, such an attack is possible and speculation can have an adverse side effects often leaking states via microarchitectural side channels which otherwise shouldn’t be accessible to the user.</p>\n<p>Again I urge the readers to go through the paper to understand the intricacies of the exploit. The RIDL paper also does a great job explaining the microarchitectural implementations in Intel processors which is wonderful.</p>\n<p>Thank you for reading till the end. I’m an undergraduate student keenly interested in Computer Architecture and I look at micro-architectural based attacks to understand more about the working of our hardware.

To improve performance and reduce logic size, one can get away by comparing only lower few digits assuming upper digits are equal. In Predictive Data Forwarding, CPU speculatively forwards data in Line Fill Buffer and Store Buffer to outstanding loads if the lower bits of address match. This improves performance in case the speculation is right however in case of a mis-speculation, the data belonging to one process might end up with another, albeit for a short period of time, before CPU state being reset to the one before speculation began. Rogue In-flight Data Load exploits this to leak secret using cache based side channel and timing analysis."}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/m1racles/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"M1RACLES: M1ssing Register Access Controls Leak EL0 State"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/processing-using-memory/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Processing using Memory (PuM)"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"cf4bf6de-7654-5eaa-a4d2-eb0da3b79d59","previousPostId":"a65f04e2-8b7e-5a13-b748-7b26fb714aec","nextPostId":"5f2027dd-436e-548e-b8ed-fbcb6a07fe3e"}},
