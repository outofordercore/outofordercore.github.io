First I would like to discuss EL0 - the E in M1RACLES. ARM-v8, like any other architecture, comes with a set of privilege level that dictate the capabilities of the program running at that level. The different levels are as shown below:</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 383px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 70.88607594936708%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"A diagram showing the different privilege levels of ARM architecture with EL0 on top with least privilege where user application run, followed by EL1, the operating system level, followed by EL2, the hypervisor level, and finally EL3 the firmware level.\"\n        title=\"A diagram showing the different privilege levels of ARM architecture with EL0 on top with least privilege where user application run, followed by EL1, the operating system level, followed by EL2, the hypervisor level, and finally EL3 the firmware level.\"\n        src=\"/static/1a206691875a56234522d0c864146941/411a4/levels.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/1a206691875a56234522d0c864146941/ff44c/levels.jpg 158w,\n/static/1a206691875a56234522d0c864146941/a6688/levels.jpg 315w,\n/static/1a206691875a56234522d0c864146941/411a4/levels.jpg 383w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 383px) 100vw, 383px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<center>\nAlt: A diagram showing the different privilege levels of ARM architecture with EL0 on top with least privilege where user application run, followed by EL1, the operating system level, followed by EL2, the hypervisor level, and finally EL3 the firmware level.\n<br/>\nSource (link opens a new tab): <a href=\"\" target=\"_blank\">https://developer.arm.com/documentation/102412/0100/Privilege-and-Exception-levels</a>\n</center>\n<p>As we go down the stack, the privilege increases as we gradually go closer to the hardware. These privilege levels guard memory and register access and trap invalid accesses.</p>\n<p>What EL0 means is that any user land program can use this functionality and hence M1RACLES is possible from a userspace program.</p>\n<h2>Missing Registers</h2>\n<p>Apple M1 contains a two bit ARM System Register encoded as s3<em>5</em>c15<em>c10</em>1 that is accessible across all the processing core of the processor. In addition to this, it is EL0 accessible for both reads and writes and hence can be used to transmit data across processes.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 188px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 175.31645569620252%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"The diagram shows the schematic of the two bit register s3_5_c15_c10_1 with possible states as 00, 01, 10 and 11\"\n        title=\"The diagram shows the schematic of the two bit register s3_5_c15_c10_1 with possible states as 00, 01, 10 and 11\"\n        src=\"/static/6299d687369846f5378832673df0bdb2/4dcb9/reg.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/6299d687369846f5378832673df0bdb2/c26ae/reg.png 158w,\n/static/6299d687369846f5378832673df0bdb2/4dcb9/reg.png 188w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 188px) 100vw, 188px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<center>\nAlt: The diagram shows the schematic of the two bit register s3_5_c15_c10_1 with possible states as 00, 01, 10 and 11\n<br/>\nMade with <a href=\"https://excalidraw.com/\" target=\"_blank\">https://excalidraw.com/</a> (link opens a new tab)\n</center>\n<h2>Transmitting Data</h2>\n<p>How do you use this two bit register to transmit data?

What is interesting is the existence of this vulnerability in Apple A14 processor - <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_saagarjha\" target=\"_blank\">Saagar Jha</a> (link opens a new tab) has a nice tweet that demos this vulnerability you can find here- <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_saagarjha/status/1397515649530830852\" target=\"_blank\">https://twitter.com/<em>saagarjha/status/1397515649530830852</a>. Could this mean this covert channel can be used by apps to send user tracking information amongst each other? Probably not as outlined by Hector himself in &#x3C;a href=”<a href=\"https://m1racles.com/#ios\">https://m1racles.com/#ios</a>” target=”</em>blank”>iOS section of M1RACLES site</a> (link opens a new tab). The only reason this is a vulnerability is because it goes against the principles of operating system by adding a cover channel for Inter Process Communication. Between cooperating processes, the data can be transmitted at 1MB/s as seen in Hector’s <a href=\"https://youtu.be/hLQKrEh6w7M\" target=\"_blank\">M1RACLES demo on YouTube</a> (link opens a new tab) where the sender is streaming video data to a receiver and receiver then playing it.</p>\n<h2>Any mitigation in sight?</h2>\n<p>As this access to registers is possible across cores, there aren’t any straightforward mitigation to implement. If it was across a single core, Hector mentioned the idea of clearing the register on context switches making them an ineffective side channel. If you are running in a virtualized environment, the hypervisor traps access to the register and hence this cover channel disappears. Only on bare metal is this possible.</p>\n<p>Again in words of Hector himself, this side channel is almost inconsequential compared to the cache based side channel that can transmit data across cooperative processes much more effectively.</p>\n<p>This is the link to Hector’s thread where he first disclosed this vulnerability - <a href=\"https://twitter.com/marcan42/status/1397387066044911618\" target=\"_blank\">https://twitter.com/marcan42/status/1397387066044911618</a> (link opens a new tab). It is a worthwhile read I promise with people chipping in their opinion and possible enhancement to data transmission protocol for better throughput.</p>\n<p>Thank you for reading till the end.

The exploit involves using a 2-bit register exposed to userspace program as a side-channel to send data across co-operating processes. Despite there being more efficient side channels to send data between co-operating processes, M1RACLES got it's own CVE as it provides a channel for two processes to talk to each other without the intervention of Operating System which goes against the ode principles of n operating system."}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/power-analysis/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Power Analysis"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/ridl/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"RIDL: Rogue In-flight Data Load "}}},"pageContext":{"id":"a65f04e2-8b7e-5a13-b748-7b26fb714aec","previousPostId":"aa7d2a4b-b08d-53e8-9690-b5374fa7095b","nextPostId":"cf4bf6de-7654-5eaa-a4d2-eb0da3b79d59"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","3257411868"]}
