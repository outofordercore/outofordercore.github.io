The counter value indicated the direction of previous branch - 0 for not taken and 1 for taken. The prediction for current branch would depend on previous branch and the result of current branch will update the counter for prediction regarding next branch. AS it turns out even one bit counters were fairly accurate at prediction but the high cost of flushing the pipeline in case of mis-prediction means these predictors needs to be as accurate as possible to improve performance.</p>\n<p>The next evolution was a two bit saturated counter, where the state 00 indicated there is a strong chance branch is not taken, state 01 meant there is a good possibility branch will be not taken, state 10 meant there is a good possibility branch will be taken and state 11 meant there is a great chance branch will be taken.

If the branch is not taken, it stays  on 00. If branch is taken despite the prediction, the state transitions to 01 getting closed to the “taken” prediction.</li>\n<li>State 01 predicts branch will not be taken (although with not as large a probability as state 00). If the branch is indeed not taken the state transitions to 00 indicating a bigger probability next branch might also not be taken. If the branch is taken, the state transitions to 10.</li>\n<li>State 10 predicts branch will be taken with moderate probability. If the branch is indeed taken the state transitions to 10 indicating a high probability next branch will be taken. If the branch is not taken despite the prediction, the state transitions to 01.</li>\n<li>State 11 strongly predicts for the branch to be taken. If the branch is indeed taken the state remains the same. If not the state transitions to 01 indicating weakening in probability for branch being taken.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Unlike a single bit predictor, two bit predictor depends on a larger branch history to predict next branch. Slightly better accuracy was achieved with more states and more transition. Modern processors have graduated from just predicting direction of branch to predicting the jump right from the program counter without even decoding instruction.</p>\n<h2>Branch History Table</h2>\n<p>One single counter for all the branches doesn’t give a clear picture for all branches. To address this, the single branch predictor now became a branch history table.</p>\n<p>The table is looked up using the pc of the branch instruction to predict whether it would be taken or not.

Consider a branch can be predicted with an accuracy of 99% (branch predictors in modern processors are in fact this accurate).</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">For every 1000 instructions, there are 100 branch instruction out of which 99 can be predicted correctly.\nTotal cycles to run 1000 instruction\n= 4 + 999 (comes from the pipelined nature)\n+ 2 (2 cycles wasted until the branch is resolved)\n+ 5 (cycles added as a result of flush)\n= 1010 cycles\n\nConsider a pipeline that adds 2 nop (no operation) in pipeline before every branch instruction\n= 4 + 999 (comes from the pipeline nature)\n+ 2 * 100 (2 nop for 100 branch instruction)\\\n= 1203  cycles</code></pre></div>\n<p>We can observe there is a clear performance gain with branch prediction compared to adding nops down the pipeline.</p>\n<h2>Coming up next</h2>\n<p>This is a brief introduction to branch prediction and hardware behind it. This is in no way a comprehensive look but it covers enough to give a foundation for the exploit we’ll cover later named Spectre.</p>\n<p><strong>This might sound repetitive by now but to get solid understanding of branch predication - from reasoning behind it, to realization in hardware - I highly recommend watching Onur Mutlu’s lectures linked at the beginning of this post. His lectures are an invaluable resource for people looking to understand computer architecture and microarchitecture implementation of these concepts in modern processors and I highly recommend watching the entire playlist to get a good understanding of braoder picture of computer architecture.</strong></p>\n<p>Thank you for reading till the end. I’m an undergraduate student keenly interested in Computer Architecture and I look at micro-architectural based attacks to understand more about the working of our hardware.
