When data needs to be accessed from a particular row, the word line is used to enable the row and the data of the row can be sampled from the bit lines aka the digit lines. These rows typically consist of 4096 cells to match the page size of most operating system and maximize performance. A row buffer is at the end of the word line to store data before it is put on the bus. In case of data access to same row, data can be read directly from the row buffer and this is called a row buffer hit, analogous to cache hit.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 600px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 100%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAUABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGAABAQADAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIBAwX/xAAUAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/9oADAMBAAIQAxAAAAHtygpA34AD/8QAGhAAAgMBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECERIQMf/aAAgBAQABBQJt3pmmS9442ZMH/8QAFBEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIP/aAAgBAwEBPwEf/8QAFBEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIP/aAAgBAgEBPwEf/8QAFBABAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMP/aAAgBAQAGPwIf/8QAGxAAAgMAAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAERUbEx0eH/2gAIAQEAAT8hWgjChy+GZ0PkQ0kbY0tn/9oADAMBAAIAAwAAABADDwD/xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAg/9oACAEDAQE/EB//xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAg/9oACAECAQE/EB//xAAeEAACAgICAwAAAAAAAAAAAAABEQAhQVEx0WGhsf/aAAgBAQABPxAzJSfEKze0DIDAXqCKNYYg6eowiQUqUr8Cx1CS/h1P/9k='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"The diagram shows the structure of a DRAM grid with multiple rows consisting of cells connected to the same word line.

The data from the activated row is then transferred to row buffer. When we illustrate these cells, they look large but in reality they are so small, their size is measured in nano meters. When components are placed far away, it is rare that one components influences the other but as we try to move to smaller processes to manufacture these and develop strategies to pack them densely, these component can end up influencing one another.</p>\n<p>When a high voltage is applied to a row, the electrical disturbance caused to the cell by this sudden activation can influence the cells nearby. These are not new phenomenon and can also be found in Flash Memory but they implement error correction, adding redundancy, to mitigate these problems. In commercial DRAM, this was never a problem before and hence there were no mechanism placed to mitigate these problems.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 385px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 104.43037974683544%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"An illustration of how an activate of one cell can cause disturbance to flip bit in the cell of an adjacent row.\"\n        title=\"An illustration of how an activate of one cell can cause disturbance to flip bit in the cell of an adjacent row.\"\n        src=\"/static/b0f79427fc83a77922fe25d9f11728b6/409e6/flip.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/b0f79427fc83a77922fe25d9f11728b6/c26ae/flip.png 158w,\n/static/b0f79427fc83a77922fe25d9f11728b6/6bdcf/flip.png 315w,\n/static/b0f79427fc83a77922fe25d9f11728b6/409e6/flip.png 385w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 385px) 100vw, 385px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<center>\nAlt: An illustration of how an activate of one cell can cause disturbance to flip bit in the cell of an adjacent row.\n<br/>\nMade with <a href=\"https://excalidraw.com/\" target=\"_blank\">https://excalidraw.com/</a> (link opens a new tab)\n</center>\n<br/>\n \n<p>A thing to note is this disturbance is not caused as a result of single read but as a result of continuous activation.</p>\n<h2>Piecing Together Row Hammer</h2>\n<p>Now we know the fundamentals behind row hammer, let us see how the authors of the paper executed it.</p>\n<p>The authors rapidly activated two rows, with a single row gap in middle, alternatively to see how the data in adjacent cells change.

Row Hammer proves that just accessing memory in a certain way can lead to data corruption and this can be exploited in various ways. The smart folks working at Google Project Zero devised a way to exploit the Row Hammer bug to get write access to the Page Table of a system essentially giving complete access of the system to the attacker. You can read more about it here (link opens a new tab): <a href=\"https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2015/03/exploiting-dram-rowhammer-bug-to-gain.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2015/03/exploiting-dram-rowhammer-bug-to-gain.html</a></p>\n<h2>Mitigation</h2>\n<p>Some of the mitigation proposed include, but not limited to, decrease time between DRAM refresh at cost of power consumption, profile memory access to prevent DRAM Row Hammer, build a larger reliable cache in DRAM to prevent rapid row activation. DRAM manufacturers implemented Targeted Row Refresh using an proprietary mechanism but the paper <strong>“TRRespass: Exploiting the Many Sides of Target Row Refresh”</strong> [<a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9152631/\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE post</a>, <a href=\"https://download.vusec.net/papers/trrespass_sp20.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">PDF</a> ~ 817KB] (link opens a new tab) reverse engineered the mechanism and showed ways of exploiting Targeted Row Refresh to induce Row Hammer vulnerability in DRAM module. There are publications such as <strong>“BlockHammer: Preventing RowHammer at Low Cost by Blacklisting Rapidly-Accessed DRAM Rows”</strong> [<a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9407238/\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE post</a>, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.05981.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">PDF</a> ~ 2.2MB] (link opens a new tab) that looks at preventing Row Hammer using open research and hopefully one day we get to a fundamental solution to this problem.</p>\n<p>Thank you for reading till the end.

Have a nice day!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Row Hammer: Flipping Bits in Memory Without Accessing Them","date":"July 02, 2021","description":"As we try to squeeze in more and more memory cells into DRAM, some of the assumptions we has made previously no longer remain true. Row Hammer is an hardware exploit that takes advantage of electrical disturbance cause by DRAM row activate to flip bits in memory. In this post, we discuss briefly how and why Row Hammer exploit exists."}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/processing-using-memory/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Processing using Memory (PuM)"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/row-clone/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"RowClone: Fast and energy-efficient in-DRAM bulk data copy and initialization"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"2a8b92f6-93b3-5b2e-b8d2-def5e7fa57da","previousPostId":"5f2027dd-436e-548e-b8ed-fbcb6a07fe3e","nextPostId":"d89b66f8-b361-5d77-8bfa-8d83da64aab2"}},
