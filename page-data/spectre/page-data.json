Although harmless in thought, this can be misused by one thread to dictate the actions of another thread in case of speculative execution.</p>\n<h2>Influencing branches</h2>\n<p>To influence branches of victim, the attacker first must find a bug in the victim program that can leak secret via a side channel. Secondly, the attacker’s program must be written in a way it trains the Branch Predictor and manipulate the values of the Branch Target Buffer in such a way that pc for branch in attacker program points to pc for another jump in victim program and the resultant pc of the jump in attacker points to the pc in victim to set of statements that leaks data via side channel.</p>\n<p>The diagram below shows a schematic of training the Branch Predictor and manipulating the Branch Target Buffer for malicious intent:</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 540px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 64.55696202531645%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"The attacker program has a conditional branch at PC 4004 which always resolves and true and jumps to PC 8000.

Especially in Intel processors, the checks are disabled and the processor continues to execute down the speculative path.</p>\n<p>The main thing to note is that this jump can be made to any arbitrary address and hence can be carried out effectively.</p>\n<h2>Device in the victim</h2>\n<p>Spectre also needs the victim program to have a device function baked into it to leak secrets via a side channel. We have already discussed about the cache side channel that uses timing to leak secrets and power based side channels that uses power draw to detect victim’s behavior.</p>\n<p>An example of device is as follows:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"c\"><pre class=\"language-c\"><code class=\"language-c\"><span class=\"token keyword\">unsigned</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">int</span> secret<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">while</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>secret<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"token keyword\">if</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>secret <span class=\"token operator\">&amp;</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n        <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n                <span class=\"token function\">shared_library_routine</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n        <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n        secret <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> secret <span class=\"token operator\">>></span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Considered secret is cached and can be loaded in few cycle. In the time processor comes out of speculation, the device would have ran a number of loops calling a <strong>shared<em>library</em>routine()</strong> whose traces can be found is cache and the secret can be leaked via timing analysis.</p>\n<p>The above example is not feasible for Spectre attack as loading the shared<em>library</em>routine() itself might take a number of cycles however the paper discusses other methods where attacker controls the register states of victim thus carrying out this attack more efficiently.</p>\n<h2>Mitigation</h2>\n<p>Mitigation for Spectre came in form of microcode update where speculative execution enforces tighter checks or a performance degrading alternate where the Branch Target Buffer is invalidated at every context switch making it hard for an attacker to train the same. The fixes via software are either ineffective or have an unacceptable performance degradation. Implementations that remove the effect of side channels are harder given the vulnerability is a part of many generations of commercial products, it is hard to mitigate. </p>\n<p>We see once again, anything shared between the threads in a core can be exploited - be it Branch Target Buffer that speculatively jumps to a device or the Last Level Cache that acts as a timing based side channel to leak information.</p>\n<p>Thank you for reading till the end.
